Thank you for considering contributing to Component Lifecycle! We appreciate your interest and are excited to collaborate with you. To ensure a smooth contribution process, please follow the guidelines outlined below.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Fork and Clone**
Please fork and clone the repository directly from the [Component Lifecycle GitHub repository](https://github.com/palcarazm/component-lifecycle).

### 2. **Branch Structure**

- **Feature Branches**: For adding new features, create a branch from the `develop`. Name your branch `feat/XXX`, where `XXX` is the issue number. If no issue exists, create one first and wait until it's validate and planned.

- **Fix Branches**: For bug fixes, create a branch from the `develop`. Name your branch `fix/XXX`, where `XXX` is the issue number. If no issue exists, create one and wait until it's confirmed and planned.

### 3. **Commit Messages**
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. When you install the project, Husky will add a commit-msg hook to enforce this convention via commit lint.

### 4. **Pull Requests**
- **Template**: Use the provided pull request template.
- **Checks**: Ensure your pull request passes all CI checks. The minimum test coverage is 80%.
- **Approval**: Pull requests must be reviewed and approved before merging.

## Testing and Validation

- **Running Tests**: Execute tests with `npm run test`. Unit Tests are written with Jest, and a minimum coverage of 80% is required. End-to-End test are written with Cypress.
- **Writing Tests**: Write tests using Jest to ensure coverage meets the 80% minimum requirement.
